### Quick Master Making Mode

The SF series makes prints from a master. A new function, speed priority mode, shortens the master-making time while still maintaining high image quality. As a result, the more pages generated from each master the lower the cost per print, making it highly economical for medium- to high-volume printing.

### Versatile Paper Handling

The SF series plays multiple roles, accepting a wide range of paper types such as recycled paper, coarse paper, cards and envelopes. Page layout printing combines multiple copies of the same page, or copies of multiple pages onto a single printed page to save paper. Conveniently condense bulky multiple-page documents in an easy-to-read format.

### Easy Operation

New, easy-to-use control panel provides intuitive operation. The information on the 128 × 64 dot LCD panel can be easily viewed, and it also shows the residual capacity of supplies to prevent an out-of-stock situation occurring. The total management system improves convenience by integrating applications in one place. Product, consumables and system information can all be checked easily on your PC.

### Outstanding Quality

The newly designed scanner attains smooth tonal gradation even with photo images. It can now reduced blown-out highlights, decrease image deterioration through improved image processing, and deliver a clearer output.

### Information Management

The SF series provides enhanced security by an optional IC card activation kit. Only an authorized user can perform printing, effective to prevent divulging information from secret documents. Running a usage report is easy with the RISO Copy Count Viewer. It counts users’ printouts which is useful for understanding expenses and usage restriction.

### Go Green

The SF series consumes 1/10th the energy, compared with energy star guidelines. The rice bran oil ink contributes to environment sustainability. Rice bran, which would be otherwise wasted, is a raw material with no VOCs, so after the oil is extracted for the ink. It can subsequently be used as fertilizer or animal feed.
